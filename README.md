# Corrade-10.3.7343.31767

This is not my work. I am simply making it available as a resource to the Corrade community.

We woke up on 12 Feb 2020, and it was gone. The support group on Second Life, the documentation and the code.

Our dear friend Kira is also gone. We miss her and wish her all the best. We will now have to carry on and support each other.

Under [releases](https://github.com/careytews/Corrade-10.3.7343.31767/releases) is the zip file for the last build of the `continuous` branch, released on 08 February 2020.
