# Informal License TL;DR

* you can use Corrade commercially or otherwise under the condition that you provide credit to Wizardry and Steamworks as the creator of Corrade.

* when assets created by Wizardry and Steamworks (scripts, graphics, documentation, etc…) are used together with Corrade (ie: creating other scripts, adding a logo to a website providing Corrade services, etc…), the assets can be considered, if more convenient, to be licensed under the CC-BY-2.0 license regardless of whatever other license they had (ie: GNU GPL, MIT, etc…).

**remark**: using the CC-BY-2.0 license for Corrade derivative works implies, for instance, that you do not have to disclose your code even if your code uses code created by Wizardry and Steamworks provided that you give credit reasonably (ie: a visible mention) to Wizardry and Steamworks for creating the Corrade software and the various snippets that are used by your code.

**example**: you can use wasURLEscape, wasCSVToList and other functions or scripts under the CC-BY-2.0 license when your explicit intent is to create a script that is going to be used with Corrade.

**counter-example**: you cannot use wasURLEscape, wasCSVToList and other functions or scripts under the CC-BY-2.0 license when creating a script that is not intended to be used with Corrade.
